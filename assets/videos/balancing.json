  "text": " Hi, my name is Kennedy Hart. I'm a soccer student-athlete here at IMG. I'm originally from Atlanta, but I've been living here in Bradenton for the past five years. I play attacking midfielder and sometimes holding midfielder depending on the game. Hi, my name is Roman Warren. I'm from Sacramento, California, and I'm a soccer senior student-athlete at IMG Academy. We're playing against the best players, the best teams in the country, so we get the chance to develop our skills. I would define student athlete as someone who is dedicated to learn both in the classroom and on the field or in the court, and they really dedicate their life and they use their talents and try to get the best out of themselves. I think learning to balance the academic and athlete life at IMG comes with time management and a willingness to make short sacrifices so that you can achieve your goals in the long run The most challenging aspect I think would just be finding the balance between making sure you know what your priorities are The schedule is so tight and there's so many things you have to do in one day that you really have to focus on every little thing. It did take me a couple months to adapt to the experience here but once I did I really enjoyed it. I was able to learn that I shouldn't associate my identity with just sports or just my grades, but beyond that it's all the valuable lessons you learn on the field or in the classroom that really shape your identity. Everything is here for you to succeed. You have to take advantage of it. But I definitely think school here is not a joke. Like we have AP classes and honor classes just like everyone else. It's definitely difficult to balance with sports, but I think just with hard work, you can get through. So I feel very honored and humbled to be this year salutatorian I have been driven to take challenging classes throughout high school I think mostly through my desire to learn and be challenged academically and becoming salutatorian was a great byproduct of my efforts. When I was going through my college search, I was looking at schools that had great academic programs and D1 soccer teams. And so I was able to visit a few schools around the country but I found that at Rice the community was super welcoming and supportive and the school really fit my personality well so that's why I chose Rice. I chose UC Irvine because I felt it had the best balance for me between soccer and school and I think it helped a little bit too being close to home so my family can now come and watch me play. The most challenging part as a soccer player specifically is managing the long seasons because we practice year round and we practice about six out of the seven days per week So it can be challenging mentally and physically to stay focused for such long periods of time but at the end of the day this really resembles the college experience so I'm grateful for it. Seeing all my hard work pay off really makes me proud and it just reinforces all the confidence I have in myself and it makes me happy that I feel like I'm making my parents proud and my siblings and my friends. I think sometimes you have to be willing to get uncomfortable and step up in a leadership role. I think learning those leadership skills from my teammates and the experience I've had on the field has allowed me to apply those things in the classroom and ultimately become a better student. We'll see you next time.",
