Welcome to the Language Learning Market, where you can find the world's best educational resources in all languages. We're building a community of people who love languages and would like you to be part of it. If you haven't subscribed yet, then join us. Now let's learn something new. It's valuable and beneficial to learn another language, but how and when? Since the 60s, numerous scientific publications have proven the benefits of starting a second language at an early age. Early childhood is an important period in which the process of learning a second language begins, while the mother tongue is acquired. Studies show that if children come into contact with another language on a natural, stable and permanent basis from birth to about three years, it is acquired along with the mother tongue. Studies show that the decisive factors in the process are nervous, cognitive, emotional stimulus and the personality of the child. The social context in which the child is immersed also helps the learning process. Parents, family and close friends are especially helpful for learners. In addition, media, books and toys that the child plays with are part of the process. Everything counts. It takes time to learn another language. parents sometimes forget this factor and expect miraculous results after a school year or an intense summer camp We have to be patient and support them year after year There are no magic tricks We need to understand that learning another language is a complex process that requires time and patience Success will come when your child wants to continue learning another language for the rest of his or her life. When it comes to the best time to teach your child a second language, the earlier the better. Even within the first six months of life, babies become keenly aware of the speech sounds in the language that surrounds them When should your child start learning a second language? As children get older, it becomes more difficult for them to hear many vowels and consonants that don't exist in their non-native language These differences will become evident in their accents when they later try to speak that non-native language Some of these perceptual changes may be reversible but the timeline for non-native-like pronunciation is very early and differs depending on the speech sounds and languages in question. Perhaps by age 3 or 5, but certainly before puberty for most people, other aspects of language like vocabulary or grammar are also developed best early. Let's try to better understand how a child's language develops as a baby. A lot happens in the first year of life in the development of a language. You can think of two different things happening simultaneously. The child understanding grows and his ability to speak grows On the understanding side a child first responds to sounds with different reactions listens when people talk begins to recognize familiar voices responds to changes in tone moves eyes towards sound, recognizes his or her name, and begins to understand single words, then phrases, then sentences. On the speaking side, babies coo and cry initially, then start early babbling, then giggling. Around six to ten months, babbling becomes more complex, and then early words begin. If you're ready to take the plunge and explore teaching your baby a second language, it is recommended to immerse your baby in the language as much as possible. If parents speak another language, well, it's a great idea to speak that language to the child. This can be done by one parent, both parents, and or the babysitter. as much as possible and consistently. They need to interact in the language as much as possible. Passive listening is less effective. Parents who are teaching their babies a second language may be concerned about developmental issues with language or general confusion. But parents really don't need to stress about this issue. Learning a second language does not harm the development of other languages. If the child is bilingual, it does not cause language disorders despite some urban myths to the contrary. In fact there are considerable social cognitive and linguistic benefits to bilingualism It is also recommended that older children continue to be immersed in the language to develop their skills If the child needs to speak the language, that is the most effective way for them to learn it. Send them to a French cooking class, for example, in which they need to ask for a croissant in French in order to get one. Or have them spend time with their grandmother, who only speaks that language. The idea of a critical period for language learning has been a hotly debated topic for years. You'll find some studies that support this idea and others that don't. Start teaching your child a second language as soon as you can. It's a pretty simple formula. The earlier and more often one hears a language, the sooner they learn it.
