Middle school STEM program is located at Spring Ridge Middle School. I tend to learn very quickly being a military child. I also have a interest in science and engineering and I hope to become some sort of engineer or environmental lawyer. The St. Mary's County Public School System has developed a rigorous and unique program of study emphasizing the core areas of mathematics and science with an infusion of technology and engineering. We regularly do what's called STEM projects where we get together and we build stuff, we design stuff. The Spring Ridge Middle School STEM Academy offers tailored mathematics, science, and technology courses. The courses are designed to deepen understanding of STEM learning by exposing students to the most current trends in technology engineering and science The focus of STEM 6 along with the accelerated study of science and mathematics allows students the opportunity to apply learned concepts through project tasks that emphasize application and synthesis. Students develop and refine research skills through science fair and capstone presentations. Robotics and coding applications are also incorporated for student engagement. Right now we are constructing our very own Rube Goldberg machines, which are oversimplified machines to complete simple tasks. My group is doing a pumping an appropriate amount of hand sanitizer into a hand. Problem-solving probably like thinking of different things to do when your original plan doesn't work. So I've got about three plans that we originally tried that I changed completely. Definitely harder it's more involved and there's a lot more homework but it also is more hands-on. You have more opportunities in fields like engineering, science, and mathematics. For more information on middle school STEM, please access the school system website at www.smcps.org.",
